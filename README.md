First version of CFD homework 2.
First,  I installed git to my computer. I learned how to use git with Visual Studio Code. I tried to upload my first code to my github account. It's all right.
Then, I created a frame of my code. The calculating method may be wrong, but it gives out good outputs.
I still need to modify my code.
